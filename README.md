# 🧠 Automatic Clothing Tagger

**Automatic Clothing Tagger** is a machine learning project focused on automatically labeling clothing items using image data. The system classifies garments by type and color.

---

## 🧵 Project Overview

This project aims to automate the tagging of clothing images by:

- 🧷 Identifying the **type of garment** using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- 🎨 Detecting the **dominant color** using **K-Means clustering**
- 🧪 Evaluating multiple hyperparameter configurations to improve performance

The system was trained on a dataset of clothing images and used as a prototype to study the viability of lightweight ML solutions for fashion classification tasks.

## 🔍 Goals

- Automatically label clothing items with:
  - **Type** (e.g., shirt, pants, dress)
  - **Color** (dominant RGB cluster)
- Study the effect of **hyperparameters** (like number of neighbors in KNN or clusters in KMeans)
- Explore the balance between **accuracy, performance, and simplicity** in ML solutions
